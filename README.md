### Frontend
<a href="https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card">Custom Button Card (Custom cards & Styling)<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card">Bubble Card (Media Control Pop-up)

### Disclaimer
The cards are primary styled by the button_card_templates at the top of the .yaml file. But some aspects are styled on each card.
I´ve not gone through the code so there's probably some styling that occurs in both places.
